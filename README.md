cbay-vims-sav-data
==================

Chesapeake Bay SAV Data collection via http://www.vims.edu/ research team. More than a spatial, and tabular data repository, the older .arc files have been converted to shapefiles, all have been converted to geojson. Future intentions include visualizing sav annual maps over time (70s-current), real-time analysis and monitoring, as well as some fancy, schmancy graphics.
