    Description:
      Abstract:
        The 1989 Chesapeake Bay SAV Coverage was mapped from 1:24,000 black
        and white aerial photography to access water quality in the Bay.
        Each area of SAV was traced onto 1:24,000 USGS quadrangles and
        classified into one of four density classes by the percentage of cover.
        The SAV beds were then digitized and converted into an Arc/Info GIS
        coverage using the procedures documented below.
      Purpose:
        The annual SAV aerial photographic monitoring program provides a
        comprehensive and accurate measure of change in SAV relative abundance 
        that has been used to link improving water quality to increases in bay
        living resources.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
	  Identification and delineation of SAV beds by
	  photointerpretation utilized all available information
	  including: knowledge of aquatic grass signatures on film,
	  distribution of SAV in 1989 from aerial photography, 1989
	  ground survey information, and aerial site surveys.  USGS 7.5
	  minute quadrangle maps (1:24,00 scale) printed by the
	  Mid-Continent Mapping Center of the National Cartigraphic
	  Information Center on stable transparent mylar were used as
	  base maps.  Distortion-free, identical copies of these base
	  maps were made at the same scale on stable transparent mylar
	  using a contact diazo process.
	  SAV beds from the 1989 aerial photographs were then mapped
	  onto these diazo mylar copies of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles.
	  Delineation of each SAV bed was facilitated by superimposing
	  the photographic print with the appropriate diazo mylar
	  quadrangle on a light table. SAV bed boundaries were then
	  traced directly onto the diazo mylar quadrangle with a
	  pencil. Where minor scale differences were evident between a
	  photograph and a quadrangle, or where significant shoreline
	  erosion or accretion had occurred since USGS publication of a
	  map, either a best fit was obtained or shoreline changes were
	  noted on the quadrangle.
	  In addition to delineating SAV bed boundaries, an estimate of SAV
	  density within each bed was made by visually comparing each
	  bed to an enlarged Crown Density Scale similar to those
	  developed for estimating forest tree crown cover from aerial
	  photography. Bed density was categorized into one of four
	  classes based on a subjective comparison with the density
	  scale. These were: 1, very sparse (<10% coverage); 2, sparse
	  (10-40%); 3, moderate (40-70%); or 4, dense (70-100%). Either
	  the entire bed or subsections within the bed were assigned a
	  bed density number (1 to 4) corresponding to the above
	  density classes.  Some  beds were subsectioned to delineate
	  where variation in SAV density ocurred. Additionally, each
	  distinct SAV unit (bed or bed subsection) was assigned an
	  identifying two letter designation unique to its map.
	  Subsections were futher identified as contiguous beds by the
	  addition of two letters unique to that sequence.  These
	  contiguous bed identifications aid the tracking and analysis
	  of single natural bed units that were subsectioned due to
	  variation in SAV density. Coupled with the appropriate SAV
	  map number and year of photography, these two letter
	  designations uniquely identify each SAV bed in the data
	  base.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The perimeters of all SAV beds mapped from the aerial
	  photography onto the diazo mylar copies were digitized in a
	  clockwise direction using a NUMONICS Model 2400/2200
	  DigiTablet Graphics Analysis System with a resolution of
	  0.001 inches (0.00254 cm) and an accuracy of 0.005 inches
	  (0.0127 cm). All coordinates were transmitted to a PRIME 9955
	  computer for data management and analysis via software
	  developed at VIMS.  The perimeter of each SAV bed was defined
	  by a polygon with a linear data point density of 127 per
	  chart inch (50 per cm, 5 meter ground resolution). The total
	  number of points defining any SAV bed is dependent on overall
	  bed size. The SAV bed perimeter was stored as X and Y
	  coordinates in centimeters from the quadrangle origin (lower
	  left corner).
	  Any "island" within a polygon (digitized SAV perimeter_ was
	  disregarded as long as a line was drawn from the outside of
	  the polygon to the "island" and the resulting polygon was
	  digitized in a clockwise direction. THe line connecting the
	  "island" polygon to the larger surrounding polygon was drawn
	  in by the digitizer operator.
	  Prior and subsequent to each digitization session, the NUMONICS
	  instrument was checked manually against a digitizing
	  standard. This was accomplished by securing a diazo mylar
	  quadrangle to the digitizing tablet. Then the mylar standard
	  was secured to the same quadrangle and digitized four times.
	  The information from digitizing the standard was transmitted
	  to the beginning of the SAV bed perimeter file on the
	  computer. The same procedure was followed at the end of each
	  digitizing session. When this file was processed by the
	  computer, the digitized area of each standard was compared to
	  the known area of the standard. If a variation between the
	  known and the mean of the observed areas exceeded 1.0%, a
	  warning was printed advising the operator to check the
	  digitizing system. In addition, checks were made with respect
	  to the absolute location of the digitizing standard as
	  secured to the map. A comparison was made between the
	  location of the standard before and after the digitizing
	  session. If the absolute location differed by more than 0.10
	  cm another warning was printed.  Any movement in absolute
	  location can be indicative of digitizer instrument drift or
	  chart movement during the digitization session.  These checks
	  assure that the final calculated bed locations are as
	  accurate as possible.
	  Maximum accuracy was maintained by exclusively using mylar
	  quadrangles and standards rather that paper ones which can
	  change scale as a function of changes in air temperature and
	  humidity in the digitizer room.  A complete outline of the
	  digitization procedure can be found in Orth et al., "Quality
	  assurance project plan for the 1987 submerged aquatic
	  vegetation distribution and abundance survey of the
	  Chesapeake and Chincoteague Bays." Plan submited to U.S. EPA,
	  Cheapeake Bay Liason Office, Annapolis, MD.
	  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) were developed to
	  facilitate orderly and efficient processing of the 1989 SAV
	  maps and the SAV bed perimeter computer files produced from
	  them, and to comply with the need for consistency, quality
	  assurance, and quality control. SOPs developed include: a
	  detailed procedure outlining 46 steps for digitization of SAV
	  maps; a 47 step checklist for editing SAV perimeter computer
	  files to insure completeness and accuracy; a digitizer log in
	  which all operations were recorded and dated, which was used
	  to guide and record editing operations; and a flow chart used
	  to track progress of all operations including changes in file
	  names.
	  Part of the quality assurance/quality control program was
	  designed to isolate and remove anomolous data and to obtain
	  accurate and representative SAV bed polygons. Every SAV bed
	  mean area was the result of at least four independent
	  digitizations of the perimeter of each SAV bed. The computer
	  calculated area for each replication, and the three bed
	  perimeters most similar in terms of area were then used for
	  the calculation of a mean area. The three replicate areas
	  used in the mean area calcuation were required to be within
	  5% or less from than of the mean bed area. All replicates
	  whose areal differences were in excess of 5% of the mean bed
	  area were flagged by the VIMS quality assurance/quality
	  control computer program for additional error assesment. The
	  VIMS error rate was normally less that 1%. The replicate bed
	  perimeter whose area was most similar to the mean area was
	  identified as the "best bed" and chosen as representative of
	  that SAV bed.  .
	  The "best bed" perimeter coordinate points were then
	  converted by VIMS to latitude and longitude and a copy of
	  each on computer tape in MOSS format was then sent to the EPA
	  Chesapeake Bay Program Computer Center for incorporation into
	  the ARC/INFO GIS.  This was done via a three step two
	  dimensional linear interpolation between the four corner
	  points of every quadrangle. At the start of the digitization
	  of of every chart, the location of each corner point in X,Y
	  cm and in latitude and longitude is recorded at the head of
	  the data files. The corners are numbered: 1 = lower left
	  corner of chart origin, 2 = upper left corner, 3 = upper right
	  corner, 4 = lower right corner. These corner points are then
	  used to convert each individual X,Y perimeter point to
	  latitude and longitude. If additional files are needed for a
	  given chart, a new set of corner points are digitized and
	  stored at the head of these files.

	  Beds with more than 0.5 hectares of contiguous area between
	  the plotted bed and the original map bed and beds that are
	  offset by at least 24 meters on their entire perimeter were
	  redigitized. After all errors had been corrected, the map was
	  replotted and the bed areas were compared with those
	  calculated on the PRIME.  A final check was completed by a
	  second person to ensure that all errors had ben corrected and
	  that any newly digitized beds were within the guidelines.
